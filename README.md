## üß∞ Setup & Build

1. **Install Go 1.18+**

2. **Clone the repo:**

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   ```

4. **Build and run:**

   Runs latest code with console (used for debugging or Resolution Mapping)
   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```


   Builds executable file without console
   ```bash
   go build -ldflags="-H windowsgui" -o TwilightEveFishing.exe
   ```
   Run executable file that was created

## üóÑÔ∏è Supported Resolutions

Each resolution is mapped with specific coordinate sets:

* `3840x2160` (4K)
* `2560x1440` (1440p)
* `1920x1080` (1080p)

You can extend support for more resolutions by adding new entries to the `resolutions` map in `main.go`.

## üìã Controls Summary

| Action                | Input                |
| --------------------- | -------------------- |
| Toggle Bot ON/OFF     | `Ctrl + F8`          |
| Change Fishing Tier   | `Ctrl + F7`          |
| Log Mouse Coordinates | `Middle Mouse Click` |

---

## üß† Tier System

Tiers correspond to different fishing locations and wait times.

```go
tiers := map[int]Tier{
  1: {WaitSec: 17},
  2: {WaitSec: 40},
  3: {WaitSec: 24},
  4: {WaitSec: 20},
  5: {WaitSec: 50},
}
```

---

## üîß Adding a New Resolution

To support a new screen resolution:

1. Add a new `Resolution` block in `resolutions`:

```go
"2560x1080": {
  Width: 2560, Height: 1080,
  MoveCheck: [2]int{...},
  HeroCheck: [2]int{...},
  YellowCheck: [2]int{...},
  GreenCheck: [2]int{...},
  InventorySlots: [][2]int{...},
  DropPoint: [2]int{...},
  FishingSpots: map[int][2]int{
    1: {...}, 2: {...}, ...
  },
},
```

2. Use `Middle Mouse Click` while in-game to log required coordinates.
